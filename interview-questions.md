# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

  Your answer: A parameter acts a placeholder awaiting for the input of data to take its place, eventually being distributed throughout an argument. The argument is the syntax used to give specific instructions when calling a script to action.

  Researched answer: Parameters are the variables in a function that act as the placeholder for the arguments, which are the actual values passed to and received by the function.



2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

  Your answer: The predefined parameters are (value => value *insert some argument*). All of the aforementioned are required, I'm not aware of any optional parameters.

  Researched answer: The function to be run ( function() ) and the value of the current element (currentValue) are required parameters, whereas index, arr, and thisValue are optional.



3. What is the difference between map and filter?

  Your answer: Map returns an array the same length of the input array, whereas filter only returns an array containing the data that meets the condition it is programmed with.

  Researched answer: Map and filter both create a new array without altering the original array. The differences are: Map calls a function for every array element and manipulates each element using instructions given to it by the function. Filter only returns an array containing elements that pass a test given to it by the function.



4. What is the difference between a function and a method?

  Your answer: A function is code designed to perform a single purpose, whereas a method is a block of code that may contain many functions and can be called upon to execute the various functions within.

  Researched answer: Functions are reusable pieces of code that always render an output when passed an argument and called upon (invoked). Methods are containers for functions.



5. What is object destructuring?

  Your answer: The breakdown of an object by its individual keys and assigned values.

  Researched answer: Object destructuring allows for extraction of data from an object at any point in the code, so that it can be assigned to new, distinct variables.



6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

  Your answer: I'm unsure about this term. I presume it refers to invoking a piece of code from a location above/higher up from the piece of code being written.

  Researched answer: Hoisting is the default behavior of Javascript to move declarations to the top of the block of code being run. This makes the code aware of the declaration, however it would still need to be defined, or initialized, by that block of code in order to avoid an error message.


## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Class Inheritance: A programming technique that helps with minimizing repetition by creating a parent-child relationship between two classes.

2. React: An open-source Javascript library used for front-end development of user interfaces.

3. React state: A built-in object that allows for tracking/management of changing data within an application.

4. React lifecycle methods: React has three lifecycle components, mounting (birth), updating (growth), and unmounting (death). Each component has methods within that can be overridden to run code a specific point in the process. 

5. DOM: Document Object Model, or the HTML structure applied to an application.
